          Our project was born from a college thesis (TCC), developed by a team
          of five young enthusiasts passionate about technology and education.
          Motivated by lectures and events, we envisioned a platform that
          encourages continuous learning and offers outstanding cost-benefit for
          businesses. Our platformâ€™s clean, intuitive design ensures an
          accessible and effective experience, making knowledge pursuit
          enjoyable and beneficial for everyone.
