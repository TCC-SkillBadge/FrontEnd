            Our project was born from a college thesis (TCC), developed by a
            team of five young enthusiasts passionate about technology and
            education. Motivated by lectures and events, we envisioned a
            platform that encourages continuous learning and offers
            outstanding cost-benefit for businesses. Our platformâ€™s clean,
            intuitive design ensures an accessible and effective experience,
            making knowledge pursuit enjoyable and beneficial for everyone.
